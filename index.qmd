# 👋 Welcome

This webpage is **under development**.  

Our goal is to build a collection of resources that use **R code** and **mathematical explanations** to make concepts in statistical modeling easier to understand.  

We will begin with the basics of **linear models**, and progressively extend toward more advanced **linear mixed models**, which are widely applied in plant and animal breeding.

## What to Expect

- **Hands-on examples**: R scripts that you can run and adapt.  
- **Step-by-step math**: showing how model equations connect to code.  
- **Conceptual explanations**: to make sense of linear models, linear mixed models and quantitative genetics.
